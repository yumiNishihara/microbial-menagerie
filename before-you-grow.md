Here are a few rules I follow:  

##To protect the environment
* You are responsible for killing anything you grow. Before disposal inactivate all of your living cultures by autoclaving it for 20 minutes or inoculating it in diluted bleach for over 24 hours.


##To protect those around you
* Label all living cultures, media and chemicals. Write the name of the organism / contents, date, and your name if several people are working at the same lab.

##To protect yourself
* Always, always, always wash your hands before and after handling cultures.
* Never eat or drink at the working area.
* Be conscious of what you touch. Don't rub your eyes.

##To prevent from contaminating cultures
* Tie back long hair and keeps your nails short.
* Clean the table with a disinfectant (70% ethanol) before and after use and remove any items that are not used.
* Sterilize all equipment and media prior to use.
* Imagine that you are covered in a thin layer of microbes and that whenever you talk or move, they fall off of you. Donâ€™t talk or reach over sterile media.
* When opening petri dishes keep them covered by hovering the lid over the dish.
